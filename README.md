MDiscordBot - MDB's very own Discord Bot!

- **/name [NAME HERE]** - returns a random nickname from the person's nickname history in the MDB chats
- **/class [CLASS CODE]** - looks up enrollment information from www.berkeleytime.org for a particular CS class (try /class 161)
- **/overheard** - responds with an overheard message from the Overheard Airtable selected randomly
- **/job [COMPANY]** - looks up who we (MDB) know at a particular company through the Referral Network Airtable
