# MDiscordBot
MDiscordBot - MDB's very own Discord Bot!

Current Functionality:

- **/spoof [NAME HERE]** - uses [Markovify](https://github.com/jsvine/markovify) trained on a person's past messages in the MDB chat to generate a fake message from them
- **/class [CLASS CODE]** - looks up enrollment information from www.berkeleytime.org for a particular CS class (try /class 161)
- **/overheard** - responds with an overheard message from the Overheard Airtable selected randomly
- **/job [COMPANY]** - looks up who we (MDB) know at a particular company through the Referral Network Airtable
- **lunch** - responds with "when's lunch @tag", tagging everyone responsible for lunch!
